# 🌍 DisasterShieldAI

> **An AI-powered Disaster Response Coordination Agent built using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Gemini 3.5 Flash.**

---

## 📌 Overview

DisasterShieldAI is an intelligent emergency response assistant that analyzes disaster reports and instantly generates a coordinated disaster response plan.

The agent identifies the disaster type, estimates its severity, calculates required emergency resources, recommends temporary shelters, assigns a response priority level, and provides actionable public safety recommendations.

The goal is to assist disaster management authorities in making faster and more informed decisions during emergencies.
